### 1. Make a timetable and stick to it




### 2. Don't buy study manual, make your own notes

I see a difference between studying actuarial concept and studing for an exam.
The former focus on understanding, while the latter focus on passing.
I personally perfer the first.


When I study, I focus on understanding the concepts instead of memorising, because by understanding the concept, all those complicated theories become much more intuative.
I can easily derive and adapt my knowledge for any situation. It quickly become second nature without much effort.
On the other hand, if I just memeorize a concept, it is imposible for me adapt if the question changes a bit.
Moreover, it always leads to fustration when forgeting something or forcing myself to memorise concept without questioning it.


That is the main reason why I never learn from study manuals, they doesn't really fully explain the ideas behind the concepts.
(And they are too expensive.)
I did not spend a single dollar in purchasing study materials as
I was able to find all textbooks either in my university library or online.


When reading textbook, I have very simple strategy: read through each chapter twice and only twice.
During the first time, I highlight key point and try to have a general idea what it the chapter is about.
During the second time, I make sure I understand each and every concept and summerise them in my notes using my own words.
There is two benefits for this.
One, I ensure I digest all concepts and able to present them on my own. If I can present a concept, I can answer exam questions about it.
Two, I never ever will open the textbooks again becuase I have everything I need in my notes.
If I forget anything, I only need to search for it in my note. No more wasting time searching through 400+ pages of textbooks.


When I am done reading a textbook, the book goes away. My notes is all I need when revising and practising for the exams.


### 3. SOA sample questions is more than enough

Before asking **how much** practise questions do we need, let's try to figure out **why** do we need them.









### 4. There is no shortcuts

Success don't come easy. 
Passing actuarial exams require huge amount of commitment.
SOA exams is not only a test of intelligence, but also a test of determination.

Moreover, from my prepective, if you pass an exam only by study the questions but not understanding the concepts, you incure a debt.
You trade off the abililblty to understand more diffuclt concepts latter on and will likely stuggle in latter exams.
That's why I find building a strong foundation is the most important.

But there is one things that I can garentee: The feeling of success after passing an exam will be second to none.

That is all I have for now.
