I'm excited to share some studying strategies that I've used to pass 7 actuarial exams on the first attempt in two and a half years.
Passing 7 exam may seem difficult at first, but it is totally feasible with the right method and determination.
I strategies I shared works very well for me, but it doesn't mean it will work for everybody.
I hope this can help you to formula your own unique stratedy and pass exams.

OK, let's get to it!



### 1. Make a timetable and stick to it

Planning ahead is very important because it enocurage discipline and provides a sense of secuirty.
When I follow my plan, I know that I am not falling behind and have adequte time to study.
I won't panic and rush throught books, nor will I ran out of time to practise. 

Therefore, the first thing I do when I decided to take a exam is to create a Excel study schedule.
I then count the number of days I have until the exam and allocate them for reading each chapter of each book with repested to number of pages in that chapter.
When I finsish each chapter, I record the date in my Excel file. By doing so, I verify that I am on schedule.

At first sight, reading 3-4 books per exam is quite daunting.
However, spreading them to 4-5 months and it seems very doable.
Just keep clam and follow the plan. 3 exams per year is very practical without a deal with the devil.



### 2. Don't buy study manual, make your own notes

I see a difference between studying actuarial concept and studing for an exam.
The former focus on understanding, while the latter focus on passing.
I personally perfer the first.

When I study, I focus on understanding the concepts instead of memorising, because by understanding the concept, all those complicated theories become much more intuative.
I can easily derive and adapt my knowledge for any situation. It quickly become second nature without much effort.
On the other hand, if I just memeorize a concept, it is imposible for me adapt if the question changes a bit.
Moreover, it always leads to fustration when forgeting something or forcing myself to memorise concept without questioning it.

That is the main reason why I never learn from study manuals, they doesn't really fully explain the ideas behind the concepts.
(And they are too expensive.)
I did not spend a single dollar in purchasing study materials as
I was able to find all textbooks either in my university library or online.

When reading textbook, I have very simple strategy: read through each chapter twice and only twice.
During the first time, I highlight key point and try to have a general idea what it the chapter is about.
During the second time, I make sure I understand each and every concept and summerise them in my notes using my own words.
There is two benefits for this.
One, I ensure I digest all concepts and able to present them on my own. If I can present a concept, I can answer exam questions about it.
Two, I never ever need to open the textbooks again becuase I have everything I need in my notes.
If I forget anything, I only need to search for it in my note. No more wasting time searching through 400+ pages of textbooks.

When I am done reading a textbook twice, the book goes away.
There is no such thing as saving a difficult topic for latter. This is no going back.
This is how I make sure my every second when holding a book do not go to waste, cause never need to look back.
When I do practise question, I only need to refresh my memeory with my own notes.
And I can understand every symbol in my own notes, obviously, becuase I wrote them.



### 3. SOA sample questions is more than enough

Before asking how much practice questions do we need, let's try to figure out why do we need them.
For me, practice questions have 2 purpose: accustom me to the question types, and verify I learn all the require concepts.

Why SOA sample question is enough?
First, those sample questions are prepared by SOA themselves. It is the closest to the real exam questions.
I even feel that the difficulty level is the same as the real exam.
Second, ~100 questions is able to cover almost every concept required in a exam.
Since I focus on understand the material, I don't need to train for every possible variation of the questions.
I just need to make sure I didn't miss a chapter or misread something.

What if I already complete the questions once? I will do it again.
By doing so, I build familiarity and confidence.
With more confidence, I am less likely to second guess my answer and go with my instincts.
Compeleting the sample question 2-3 times is adequate for me to feel safe and confidence.
To be hornest, the exam questions are also very repetitive.
You definite have learnt a way to solve it.
When facing diffcult questions, I will just fall back to first principals and try multiple approach until it works. And, it works.



### 4. There is no shortcuts

Success don't come easy. 
Passing actuarial exams requires huge amount of commitment.
SOA exams is not only a test of intelligence, but also a test of determination.

Moreover, from my prepective, if you pass an exam only by study the questions but not understanding the concepts, you incure a debt.
You trade off the ability to understand more diffuclt concepts latter on and will likely stuggle in latter exams.
That's why I find building a strong foundation is the most important.

But there is one things that I can guarentee: The feeling of success after passing the exams will be second to none.
